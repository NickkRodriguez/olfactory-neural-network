# Olfactory Neural Network

## Motivation: 
Olfactory senses are vital to the human experience but have not received nearly as much attention in the deep learning community as vision and hearing have. Possible applications of an olfactory neural network can impact military, medical, and policing industries as well as recognizing new synthetic odors.

## Problem: 
Identify odor descriptions from molecules using a graph neural network.
